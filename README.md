This is a demo application for displaying download statistics for npm packages.
Project is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) technology. I also uses [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) as an UI components library.
For graphs it uses [Recharts](http://recharts.org/en-US/) js library.

Application allows to chose several packages names in the input block, select dates range and display graphs for each package on the same coordinate system.

Demo is [here](https://256322.selcdn.ru/react/npm/0.2/index.html).
